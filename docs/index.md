# Welcome to myriAD

myriAD is a REST API for Microsoft Active Directory. 

myriAD was originally implemented as a custom extension to Synapse.Server and provides a fully featured, RBAC-enabled JSON interface to AD.  Documentation for that implementation can be found in the [Synapse - Active Directory Handler](https://synapse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/handlers/ad/handler/) documentation.

myriAD hos now been implemented as a stand-alone, serverless client for performing LDAP queries against Microsoft Active Directory as well as any other, generic LDAP servers.  The documention here represents the newly implemented version and should be considered the most up-to-date.


Here are some of the highlights :
